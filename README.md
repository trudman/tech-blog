# 14 Model-View-Controller (MVC): Tech Blog

## Description

This project was my MVC Tech Blog Application. This project was very challenging due to the fact that we had to create everything from the ground up using newly learned material. I found it very difficult to work with the handlebars and login rendering. It was very good practice to better familiarize myself with trouble shooting errors. I was unable to fully complete the project but was able to learn a lot during this process. It has allowed me to become more confident with errors and troubleshooting my code.
